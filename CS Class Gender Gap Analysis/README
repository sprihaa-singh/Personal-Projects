In this project, I used Pandas and Matplotlib to analyze and create visual representations of the gender split in the Computer Science related courses at my High School over a span of two school years. 

My objective was to reveal the differences in the gender ratio split in classes between the two years to see if newly enacted school policies helped even out the gender imbalance in the impacted courses.
