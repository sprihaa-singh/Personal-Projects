This project was a game I made using the Arcade Library for Python. 

The objective of the game is to navigate mazes of varying difficulty to collect randomly generated treasure while escaping from the Zombie. To win, the player must clear all three levels, or they must restart. To view the game running, see the Game Demo file.
