In this project, I created an algorithm to solve the Chinese Ring Puzzle, which traditionally has 9 rings. 

My solution combines a mathematically derived piecewise function and recursion to solve the puzzle by returning a binary visual representation of the solution to a puzzle with any number of rings.
